- 👋 Hi, I’m @torwalson
- 👀 I’m interested in python, c++ and js with vue.js framework and have worked on projects involving acummulating sensor data and showing it to customers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python on UiT in Norway and doing some C++ on the side with unreal engine. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I am junior developer that have put my toes in many places :P So feel free to give me a wink about anything you could imagine. 
- 📫 Please reach out either trough github or linkedin. https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronny-stirling-1ba7b6a6/
